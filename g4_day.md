# How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?

The memory capacity of the human brain was reported to have the equivalent of 2.5 petabytes of memory capacity (2010 Scientific American)

2.5 PB = 2,500 TB = 2,500,000 GB

Amount of USB needed = 2500000/4 = 625000

We will need 625000 4GB USBs to download the memories of an adult.
